# webaudit360



WebAudit360 is designed to be your all‑in‑one website health checker: simply paste in any URL, and within seconds you receive a detailed snapshot of how your site performs, how it’s structured for search engines, and whether it meets basic accessibility standards. Under the hood, WebAudit360 fetches the page’s HTML using a browser‑like client, then parses and analyzes it to gather vital metrics—everything from page load times and core web vitals (like FCP and LCP) to counts of images, links, and header tags.

Beyond raw speed, WebAudit360 shines a light on your on‑page SEO and content structure by extracting the page title, meta descriptions, header hierarchies, and totals for images and anchor links. This gives you clear guidance on whether search engines are seeing the right signals. At the same time, the tool performs basic accessibility checks flagging missing alt attributes on images and checking for logical header nesting—so you can begin to address barriers for users with assistive technologies.

Finally, every audit run stores the original HTML and all derived data in a lightweight database, letting you retrieve past reports via a simple API. Whether you’re a developer troubleshooting load‑time bottlenecks, an SEO specialist fine‑tuning your metadata, or a site owner ensuring your pages are usable by everyone, WebAudit360 delivers a self‑hosted, extensible platform to help you optimize speed, visibility, and inclusivity all from a single, easy‑to‑use interface.
